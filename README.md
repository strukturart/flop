Is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a> chat client for KaiOS, built with a local-first approach â€” your data stays on your device by default.
Currently, you can exchange text messages, pictures, and your location with others. You can create new chats and join existing ones, all without relying on a central server.

### Features

## yes, but

In order to establish a connection between 2 peers, you have to know the id of the peers. To do this, I use the API: mozActivity / webActivity, which enables the exchange via a URL (sharing by SMS or EMAIL).

### known problems

In certain cases a connection between two peers cannot be established. The solution should be a separate TURN server, which can be specified when establishing the connection. The connection data to the TURN server must be saved in an .env

`TURN_APP_KEY=xx
TURN_APP_NAME=xx`
