## yes, but

In order to establish a connection between 2 peers, you have to know the id of the peers. To do this, I use the API: mozActivity / webActivity, which enables the exchange via a URL (sharing by SMS or EMAIL). In KaiOS there is also the option of deep linking, which I don't use because KaiOS 3 is not very widespread.

Two zip files will be created, one for KaiOS 2 and one for KaiOS 3

`npm run web`

### known problems

In certain cases a connection between two peers cannot be established. The solution should be a separate TURN server, which can be specified when establishing the connection. The connection data to the TURN server must be saved in an .env

`TURN_APP_KEY=xx
TURN_APP_NAME=xx`
